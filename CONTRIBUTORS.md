### Harpy Project Contributors
This repo is a Swift language port of [Harpy](http://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy). We couldn't have built this port without acknowledging the following developers who were instrumental in getting Harpy to v3.2.1, the version of Harpy that Siren was based on.

A huge **Thank You** to the following developers:

### Special Thanks
Finally, a massive **Thank You** to [Aaron Brager](http://twitter.com/GetAaron) for the dev-work and issue-moderation he's done on Harpy since 2012. A Swift port could not have happened without him.
