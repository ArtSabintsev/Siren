# Siren

### Notify users when a new version of your app is available, and prompt them with the App Store link.

---
## About
**Siren** checks a user's currently installed version of your iOS app against the version that is currently available in the App Store.

If a new version is available, an alert can be presented to the user informing them of the newer version, and giving them the option to update the application. Alternatively, Siren can notify your app programmatically, enabling you to inform the user through alternative means, such as a custom interface.

- Siren is built to work with the [**Semantic Versioning**](http://semver.org/) system.
	- Semantic Versioning is a three number versioning system (e.g., 1.0.0)
	- Siren also supports two-number versioning (e.g., 1.0)
	- Siren also supports four-number versioning (e.g., 1.0.0.0)
- Siren is a Swift language port of [**Harpy**](http://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy), an Objective-C library that achieves the same functionality.
- Siren is actively maintained by [**Arthur Sabintsev**](http://github.com/ArtSabintsev) and [**Aaron Brager**](http://twitter.com/getaaron).

## Features
- [x] CocoaPods Support
- [x] Localized for 20+ languages (See **Localization** Section)
- [x] Three types of alerts (see **Screenshots & Alert Types**)
- [x] Optional delegate methods (see **Optional Delegate** section)

## Screenshots

- The **left picture** forces the user to update the app.
- The **center picture** gives the user the option to update the app.
- The **right picture** gives the user the option to skip the current update.
- These options are controlled by the `SirenAlertType` enum.

## Installation Instructions

### CocoaPods
```ruby
pod 'Siren'
```

Add `import Siren` to any `.Swift` file that references Siren via a CocoaPods installation.

### Carthage
``` swift
github "ArtSabintsev/Siren"
```

### Swift Package manager
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren.git", majorVersion: 0)
```

Add `import Siren` to any `.Swift` file that references Siren via a Carthage installation.

### Manual

1. [Download Siren](//github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren/archive/master.zip).
2. Copy the `Siren` folder into your project.

## Setup

Here's some commented sample code. Adapt this to meet your app's needs.

```Swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool
{
	/* Siren code should go below window?.makeKeyAndVisible() */

	// Siren is a singleton
	let siren = Siren.sharedInstance

	// Required: Your app's iTunes App Store ID
	siren.appID = <#Your_App_ID#>

	// Optional: Defaults to .Option
	siren.alertType = <#SirenAlertType_Enum_Value#>

	/*
	    Replace .Immediately with .Daily or .Weekly to specify a maximum daily or weekly frequency for version
	    checks.
	*/
    siren.checkVersion(.Immediately)

    return true
}

func applicationDidBecomeActive(application: UIApplication)
{
	/*
	    Perform daily (.Daily) or weekly (.Weekly) checks for new version of your app.
	    Useful if user returns to your app from the background after extended period of time.
    	 Place in applicationDidBecomeActive(_:).	*/

    Siren.sharedInstance.checkVersion(.Daily)
}

func applicationWillEnterForeground(application: UIApplication)
{
   /*
	    Useful if user returns to your app from the background after being sent to the
	    App Store, but doesn't update their app before coming back to your app.

       ONLY USE WITH SirenAlertType.Force
   */

    Siren.sharedInstance.checkVersion(.Immediately)
}
```

And you're all set!

### Prompting for Updates without Alerts

Some developers may want to display a less obtrusive custom interface, like a banner or small icon. To accomplish this, you can disable alert presentation by doing the following:

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool
{
	...
	siren.delegate = self
	siren.alertType = .None
	...
}

extension AppDelegate: SirenDelegate
{
    // Returns a localized message to this delegate method upon performing a successful version check
    func sirenDidDetectNewVersionWithoutAlert(message: String) {
        println("\(message)")
    }

    // Returns the new store app version and the app name to create a full message or custom UI with those values
    func sirenDidDetectNewVersionWithoutAlert(newAppVersion: String, appName: String) {
        print("\(newAppVersion) - \(appName)")
    }
}
```

Siren will call the `sirenDidDetectNewVersionWithoutAlert(message: String)` delegate method, passing a localized, suggested update string suitable for display. Implement this method to display your own messaging, optionally using `message`.

If the user implements `sirenDidDetectNewVersionWithoutAlert(newAppVersion: String, appName: String)` , Siren will call this delegate method, passing the new app version and the app name. Implement this method to create a custom UI according to your app's needs using `newAppVersion` and `appName`.

## Differentiated Alerts for Revision, Patch, Minor, and Major Updates
If you would like to set a different type of alert for revision, patch, minor, and/or major updates, simply add one or all of the following *optional* lines to your setup *before* calling the `checkVersion()` method:

```swift
	/* Siren defaults to SirenAlertType.Option for all updates */
	siren.sharedInstance().revisionUpdateAlertType = <#SirenAlertType_Enum_Value#>
	siren.sharedInstance().patchUpdateAlertType = <#SirenAlertType_Enum_Value#>
	siren.sharedInstance().minorUpdateAlertType = <#SirenAlertType_Enum_Value#>
	siren.sharedInstance().majorUpdateAlertType = <#SirenAlertType_Enum_Value#>
```

## Optional Delegate and Delegate Methods
Five delegate methods allow you to handle or track the user's behavior:

```	swift
@objc protocol SirenDelegate {
    optional func sirenDidShowUpdateDialog()    // User presented with update dialog
    optional func sirenUserDidLaunchAppStore()  // User did click on button that launched App Store.app
    optional func sirenUserDidSkipVersion()     // User did click on button that skips version update
    optional func sirenUserDidCancel()          // User did click on button that cancels update dialog
    optional func sirenDidDetectNewVersionWithoutAlert(message: String) // Siren performed version check and did not display alert
    optional func sirenDidDetectNewVersionWithoutAlert(newAppVersion: String, appName: String)  // Siren performed version check and did not display alert, only send version number and app name for a full custom UI
}
```

## Force Localization
Harpy is localized for Arabic, Armenian, Basque, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Slovenian, Swedish, Spanish, Thai, and Turkish.

You may want the update dialog to *always* appear in a certain language, ignoring iOS's language setting (e.g. apps released in a specific country).

You can enable it like this:

```swift
Siren.sharedInstance.forceLanguageLocalization = SirenLanguageType.<#SirenLanguageType_Enum_Value#>
```
## Testing Siren
Temporarily change the version string in Xcode (within the `.xcodeproj`) to an older version than the one that's currently available in the App Store. Afterwards, build and run your app, and you should see the alert.

If you currently don't have an app in the store, use the **AppID** for the iTunes Connect App (*376771144*), or any other app, and temporarily change the version string in `.xcodeproj` to an older version than the one that's currently available in the App Store.

For your convenience, you may turn on `printn()` debugging statements by setting `self.debugEnabled = true` before calling the `checkVersion()` method.

## App Store Submissions
The App Store reviewer will **not** see the alert. The version in the App Store will always be older than the version being reviewed.
