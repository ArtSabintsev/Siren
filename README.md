## About
**Siren** checks a user's currently installed version of your iOS app against the version that is currently available in the App Store.

If a new version is available, an alert can be presented to the user informing them of the newer version, and giving them the option to update the application. Alternatively, Siren can notify your app programmatically, enabling you to inform the user through alternative means, such as a custom interface.

- Siren is built to work with the [**Semantic Versioning**](https://semver.org/) system.
	- Canonical Semantic Versioning uses a three number versioning system (e.g., 1.0.0)
	- Siren also supports two-number versioning (e.g., 1.0) and four-number versioning (e.g., 1.0.0.0)
- Siren is actively maintained by [**Arthur Sabintsev**](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev) and [**Aaron Brager**](https://twitter.com/getaaron)

## Features
- [x] CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager Support
- [x] Three Types of Alerts (see [Screenshots](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren#screenshots))
- [x] Highly Customizable Presentation Rules
- [x] Localized for 40+ Languages (see [Localization](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren#localization))
- [x] Device Compatibility Check (see [Device Compatibility](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren#device-compatibility))

## Screenshots
- The **left picture** forces the user to update the app.
- The **center picture** gives the user the option to update the app.
- The **right picture** gives the user the option to skip the current update.
- These options are controlled by the `Siren.AlertType` enum.

```

### Carthage
```swift
github "ArtSabintsev/Siren" // Swift 4.2
github "ArtSabintsev/Siren" "swift4.1" // Swift 4.1
github "ArtSabintsev/Siren" "swift3.2" // Swift 3.2
github "ArtSabintsev/Siren" "swift3.1" // Swift 3.1
github "ArtSabintsev/Siren" "swift2.3" // Swift 2.3
```

### Swift Package Manager
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren.git", majorVersion: 3)
```

## Implementation Examples
Implementing Siren is as easy as adding one line of code to your app. Siren also has plenty of customization options. Most common examples can be found below.

**WARNING**: Siren code should ONLY be placed in [UIApplication.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application) and only below the `window?.makeKeyAndVisible()` call. Siren initializes a listener on [didBecomeActiveNotification](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsnotification.name/1622953-uiapplicationdidbecomeactive) to perform version checks.

### Default Implementation

```Swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
	window?.makeKeyAndVisible()

	Siren.shared.wail()

    return true
}
```

### Default Implementation with Completion Handler

```Swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
	window?.makeKeyAndVisible()

	Siren.shared.wail { (results, error) in
	if let results = results {
		print("AlertAction ", results.alertAction)
		print("Localization ", results.localization)
		print("LookupModel ", results.lookupModel)
		print("UpdateType ", results.updateType)
	} else if let error = error {
		print(error.localizedDescription)
	}
}

    return true
}
```

### Custom Alert Presentation Implementation with Completion Handler

The `PresentationManager` is used to customize the UI of the `UIAlertController` used by Siren. It can customize the tint color, app name, language localization, and all the message strings. 

**WARNING:** Customizing any of the message strings opts the user out of SIren's bundled language translations.

## Localization
Siren is localized for
- Arabic
- Armenian
- Basque
- Chinese (Simplified and Traditional)
- Croatian
- Czech
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- Estonian
- Finnish
- French
- German
- Greek
- Hebrew
- Hungarian
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Latvian
- Lithuanian
- Malay
- Norwegian (BokmÃ¥l)

- Polish
- Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal)
- Russian
- Serbian (Cyrillic and Latin)
- Slovenian
- Spanish
- Swedish
- Thai
- Turkish
- Ukrainian
- Urdu
- Vietnamese

You may want the update dialog to *always* appear in a certain language, ignoring iOS's device-specific setting

You can enable it like so:

```swift
// Assuming you have `let siren = Siren.shared somewhere in your code`
// In this example, we force the `russian` language.
siren.presentationManager = PresentationManager(forceLanguageLocalization: .russian)
```
## Device Compatibility
If an app update is available, Siren checks to make sure that the version of iOS on the user's device is compatible with the one that is required by the app update. For example, if a user has iOS 10 installed on their device, but the app update requires iOS 11, an alert will not be shown. This takes care of the *false positive* case regarding app updating.

## Testing Siren
Temporarily change the version string in Xcode (within the `.xcodeproj`) to an older version than the one that's currently available in the App Store. Afterwards, build and run your app, and you should see the alert.

If you currently don't have an app in the store, change your bundleID to one that is already in the store. In the sample app packaged with this library, we use the [App Store Connect](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1234793120) app's bundleID: `com.apple.AppStoreConnect`.

For your convenience, you may turn on debugging statements by setting `self.debugEnabled = true` before calling the `checkVersion()` method.

## App Store Submissions
The App Store reviewer will **not** see the alert. The version in the App Store will always be older than the version being reviewed.

## Phased Releases
In 2017, Apple announced the [ability to rollout app updates gradually (a.k.a. Phased Releases)](https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/apps/faq/Managing%20Your%20Apps_Submission%20Process). Siren will continue to work as it has in the past, presenting an update modal to _all_ users. If you opt-in to a phased rollout for a specific version, you have a few choices:

- You can leave Siren configured as normal. Phased rollout will continue to auto-update apps. Since all users can still manually update your app directly from the App Store, Siren will ignore the phased rollout and will prompt users to update.
- You can set `showAlertAfterCurrentVersionHasBeenReleasedForDays` to `7`, and Siren will not prompt any users until the latest version is 7 days old, after phased rollout is complete.
- You can remotely disable Siren until the rollout is done using your own API / backend logic.

## Words of Caution
Occasionally, the iTunes JSON will update faster than the App Store CDN, meaning the JSON may state that the new version of the app has been released, while no new binary is made available for download via the App Store. It is for this reason that Siren will, by default, wait 1 day (24 hours) after the JSON has been updated to prompt the user to update. To change the default setting, please modify the value of `showAlertAfterCurrentVersionHasBeenReleasedForDays`.
